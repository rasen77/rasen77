## Hi, I'm Pedro 

I’m 19 years old and currently studying Software Engineering at Una, Brazil. I’m also learning English — although it’s challenging, I enjoy the process and have a passion for learning new languages. I’m enthusiastic about problem-solving and passionate about soccer. To improve my skills, I practice by writing everything in English.
